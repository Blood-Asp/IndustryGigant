Work in progress modpack.

Industry Gigant is a modpack abount building huge factorys, automation and trading. The basic mods are GregTech 5 and RotaryCraft. Immersive Engineering and Magneticraft have been deeply integrated, partly replacing some GregTech machines. 

The oregen in the world has been deactivated! You must buy metals and ores ingame with credits.

All metals have been removed from the furnace and can be molten in the Tinkers Construct Smeltery. Also the alloysmelter has been deactivated and replaced by the smeltery.
